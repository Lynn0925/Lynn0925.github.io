<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics and Applications "R. Caccioppoli" of the University of Naples Federico II, under the supervision of [Prof.Francesco Piccialli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CLNn_9gAAAAJ).
Prior to this, I received my master's degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics under the supervision of [Prof.Xiaoyang Tan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rHMtSOYAAAAJ). 

My research interest includes Trustworthy AI, Federated Learning, and Computer Vision.
